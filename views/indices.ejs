                      <h3 class="subtitle">What are indices</h3>
                      <p>Indices (also known as stock indexes) represent the value of a group of assets or stocks listed on a particular exchange. Major financial indices include the Dow Jones Industrial Average, ASX 200, Hang Seng, China A 50 and Straits Times Index. Different indices (or indexes) have their own criteria for determining constituent stocks.</p>
                      <p>The Dow Jones Index represents 30 large public-listed companies traded on the New York Stock Exchange weighted by price, whereas the FTSE 100 represents 100 of the largest blue-chip companies in the UK weighted by market capitalisation.</p>
                      <p>At Apexstack, we offer CFDs on most major global indices, including the AUS 200, HK 50, CHINA 50 and SING 30. When the price of stocks listed on an index rise, the price of the index goes up. When the prices of stocks listed on an index go down, the value of the index falls along with it.</p>
                      <p>Indices have the advantage of allowing traders to take a wider view of a basket of stocks rather than taking a view on one individual stock alone. Online CFD and futures based indices are offered on all platforms.</p>
                      <p>Stock indices give you a chance to invest an opinion of an economy without having to pick individual stocks. CFD investment is one of the most popular products to invest.</p>

                      <h3 class="subtitle">Stock Index CFD: Invest on Margin</h3>
                      <p>Investing in stocks has a wide appeal globally, but the barrier to entry can often be high. Say you want to invest in an economy through an index to attempt to mirror the performance of that economy. You could simply buy shares in all the stocks on the index, but that could get costly, especially in light of broker's fees for transactions. Some turn to the futures market, investing the index through an ETF. The ETF is a fund that has shares in all the stocks in the index. With ETFs, you generally have 100% margin, meaning you have to put up the full value of the index to participate.</p>
                      <ul class="info__list mt-4">
                        <li style="width: 100%">Apexstack's index products, however, are invested as contracts for difference (CFDs). With CFDs, you can place invests on margin. You put up a fraction of the capital and still get the full value of the invest. But that's not all.</li>
                        <li style="width: 100%">investing indices as CFDs removes the barrier to investing. When you invest on the futures market, you have settlement periods. Short selling is typically impossible without a significant account balance. Plus the fees for each transaction are significant.</li>
                        <li style="width: 100%">Index CFDs, on the other hand, have no settlement periods, short selling is available, and you only pay the spread. With CFDs, you can scalp the market much more easily, decrease your risk exposure and be able to enter the market with lower capital requirements in your account.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <h3 class="subtitle">How an Index CFD investment Works</h3>
