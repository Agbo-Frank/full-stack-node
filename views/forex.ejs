                      <p>The majors and the commodity pairs are the most liquid and most widely traded currency pairs in the forex market. These pairs and their combinations (EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY and EUR/GBP) make up the vast majority of all trading on the forex. Due to the fact they attract the largest volume of buyers and sellers, spreads are typically the tightest.</p>
                      <ul class="info__list mt-4">
                        <li style="width: 100%"><strong>Majors:</strong>  EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CHF</li>

                      </ul>
                      <p>However, there are other currency pairs that allow you to take advantage of macroeconomic events in specific international markets, such as the USD/MXN (US Dollar/Mexican Peso).</p>
                      <h3 class="subtitle">How Do You Make Money With Forex Trading?</h3>
                      <p>The international currency trade furnishes participants with an unparalleled collection of opportunities. Given the depth and liquidity of the forex, it is possible to implement almost any viable strategy with maximum efficiency. From short-term intraday approaches to multi-session swing trading plans, profiting from periodic exchange rate fluctuations can become not only possible but probable.</p>
                      <p>Perhaps the single most beneficial attribute of the forex is flexibility. Unlike in more conventional trading modules such as stocks, ,<strong>forex trading profits are not limited only to buying low and selling high.</strong> You are able to make money from being either long or short a specific market, increasing the number of potential trading opportunities exponentially.</p>
                      <p>Whether your outlook on a currency is bullish or bearish, you have the ability to capitalise upon the idea. <strong> Buy low and sell high or sell high and buy low</strong> ― the forex does not limit your trading options or your money-making potential.</p>

                      <h3 class="subtitle">How to calculate your Forex Profit?</h3>
                      <p>As it pertains to any business ― active trading or otherwise ― profit is the difference between gains and losses minus operating expenses. The beauty of forex trading is that quantifying profit is straightforward because expenses are limited, and gains and losses are easily accounted for.</p>
                      <p>The best way to manage profit is through regularly referencing your trading platform. Software suites such as Trading Station, Metatrader 4 and ZuluTrade calculate gains and losses on a pip-by-pip basis. As the market moves, your account balance is updated automatically via the functionality of your platform.</p>
                      <p>At the end of the day, making money is the goal of any trader. With FXCM, you will always know your P&L, freeing up time for active trading.</p>

                      <p>When it comes to risk management in forex trading, it's all about pip value. Knowing how much your trade's pips are worth is key to not overextending your account.

                      <p>One of the greatest advantages to trading forex in the modern era is access to technology that aids in the application of indicators such as Pivot Points.
