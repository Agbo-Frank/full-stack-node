                            <p>COMEX Copper is widely considered as one of the key cyclical commodities, given its extensive usage in construction, infrastructure and an array of equipment manufacturing. The biggest end-use is for the production of cables, wiring and electrical goods because of its excellent electricity conducting properties. The construction sector is the second largest user of copper, for plumbing, HVAC and building wiring applications. Although found in abundance and widely extracted as well as recycled, the copper value chain is quite capital intensive. This makes the market susceptible to supply-side constraints, and therefore, volatile price fluctuations.                            </p>

                            <p>Gold is traded in the spot market, and the gold spot price is quoted as US dollar per troy ounce. Since 1919, the most common benchmark for the price of gold has been the London gold fixing, a twice-daily telephone meeting of representatives from five bullion-trading firms of the London bullion market. Gold is traded continuously throughout the world based on the intra-day spot price, derived from over-the-counter gold-trading markets around the world (code XAU).</p>

                            <p>The price of silver is driven by speculation and supply and demand—mainly by large traders or investors, short selling, industrial, consumer and commercial demand, and to hedge against financial stress. Compared to gold, the price of silver is notoriously volatile. This is because of lower market liquidity, and demand fluctuations between industrial and store of value uses. At times this can cause wide-ranging valuations in the market creating volatility.</p>
