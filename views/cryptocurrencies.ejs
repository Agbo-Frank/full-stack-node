                      <h3 class="subtitle">What are crypto currencies</h3>
                      <p>Cryptocurrencies are a digital form of currency that can be traded and used to pay for things. Their value is determined by supply and demand – which makes them highly speculative and unpredictable.</p>
                      <p>Cryptocurrencies were born out of a counter culture – the desire to trade in a currency that was neither regulated by any central bank, nor influenced by national currencies and major economic events.

                        Cryptos use distributed ledger technology, or blockchain, to maintain a public record of all transactions. Tokens or coins can be bought and sold and are stored in a digital wallet, either online through an exchange like Binance, or offline ‘in cold storage’ on a server.
                        
                        When Bitcoin was first released in 2009, most financial institutions thought it would be a flash in the pan and amount to nothing. Nine years later Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies crashed and the sceptics felt vindicated. But crypto has bounced back and, in 2020, Bitcoin soared to more than US$60,000 per coin. It crossed this level again in October 2021. Although there were two major sell-offs in spring and summer of 2021, Bitcoin and other major crypto currencies are showing signs of a swift comeback, and many crypto aficionados, including Fundstrat Global Advisors' Tom Lee, predict a price point of $100,000 for Bitcoin before the start of 2022.</p>

                      <h3 class="subtitle">How to trade cryptocurrency using CFDs</h3>
                      <p>As the owners of Bitcoin have benefited from its soaring value in the last few years, so too have traders. Using CFDs, take the first steps into the crypto market with just a fraction of the capital required. You'll gain full exposure to a market that's highly volatile.</p>
                      <p>Much like forex trading, cryptocurrency trading is done in pairs. With a CFD, you are agreeing to exchange the difference in the price of a cryptocurrency between opening and closing positions.</p>
                      <p>Opting for a long position can lead to profits if the chosen cryptocurrency's value rises, while a short position can result in gains if the value goes down. It's crucial to recognise that, like any investment, there is the risk of losses. Our trading platform empowers you to maintain control over your trades at all times.</p>

                      <h3 class="subtitle">Crypto trading with Apexstack: What you need to know</h3>
                      <p>If you think the crypto market is where the best opportunities lie for you, it is important to be aware of the risks that exist. Like all forms of trading using CFDs, you are fully exposed to the market and, as a Professional client, you may lose all of your initial crypto investment.</p>
                      <p>One of the unique features of the crypto market is its volatility, which can be extreme at times. Trading with leverage in a volatile market means that your losses may be rapid. So, never risk more than you can afford to lose in order to safeguard your portfolio.</p>
                      <p>It is also a good idea to be clear on how both the crypto market and CFDs work. You can check out the Apexstack Knowledge Base for more support and insight whenever you need it.</p>
